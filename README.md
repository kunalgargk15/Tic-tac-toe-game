# Tic-tac-toe game
Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game that is played on a 3x3 grid. Each player takes turns marking a square on the grid with their symbol, either an X or an O. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all of the squares on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game is a tie.

Our Tic Tac Toe game made using C++ allows players to play against each other or against the computer. The game is designed to be easy to understand and play, with a clean and user-friendly interface. Players can choose their symbol (X or O) and take turns making moves on the grid until the game is won or ends in a tie. The game keeps track of each player's score and displays the results after each round.
